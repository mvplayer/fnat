1
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:20,620
Follow me.

2
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:49,849
Come on, you...

3
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:51,450
Can't get a shot.

4
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:12,972
Come on...
Come on.

5
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,301
<i>There's a storm right now.</i>

6
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:45,705
<i>A hundred and sixty
miles per hour.</i>

7
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,942
<i>And we still
have gusts around 190.</i>

8
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:54,413
<i>So this area, this territory,
is certainly very much in danger.</i>

9
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:58,752
<i>Fifteen inches of rainfall possible
across parts of Puerto Rico.</i>

10
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,921
<i>And life-threatening mudslides</i>

11
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:04,657
<i>and really more flash flooding.</i>

12
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:08,728
<i>This is where we will see
the storm surge, storm winds...</i>

13
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:12,766
<i>There will certainly be damage.</i>

14
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,424
<i>The entire territory will
be absolutely under the control</i>

15
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:16,395
<i>of this category four,
maybe category five storm.</i>

16
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:20,633
Shh.
You got something we want.

17
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:31,978
Walk normal.

18
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:33,580
You walk normal.

19
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:35,849
If you say anything
I'll shoot you

20
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:37,449
and the person next to you.

21
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,553
How can I help you?

22
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,724
Thank you.

23
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,875
He... he wouldn't even
tell me his name.

24
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,710
It was... it was arranged
through a third-party.

25
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:05,578
- I don't know anything...
- Calm down, calm down.

26
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:06,646
It's okay.

27
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:11,918
What's the address?

28
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:20,860
<i>Here's Puerto Rico: 3.5
million Americans live there.</i>

29
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:23,663
<i>And here it comes,
right along the shore.</i>

30
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:26,099
<i>But San Juan is still
going to have winds</i>

31
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:28,868
<i>of 130 to 140 miles an hour.</i>

32
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:30,803
<i>There will be weeks
without power.</i>

33
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:33,538
<i>There may be weeks
without water.</i>

34
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,808
I need to sit.

35
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,476
I need...
Please, I need to...

36
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,078
John. John.

37
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:51,490
Let's go.

38
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:53,026
Where's Babie?

39
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:54,994
The old prune panicked.

40
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:56,629
Babie was aborted.

41
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,798
Come on. Let's go.

42
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:11,330
Whoo.

43
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:44,997
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey.

44
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:48,101
Cardillo, I need the keys
to the prisoner holding cell.

45
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:51,170
Yes, sir.
There you go.

46
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:52,905
Mom make bail?

47
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:56,109
Cardillo!

48
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:58,811
- Wow. Yeah?
- This is Officer Pena.

49
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:00,213
She'll be assisting
with the evacs.

50
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:02,849
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

51
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:04,717
The two of you
will take the van.

52
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,986
You'll be scouring
every last motherfucking inch

53
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,721
- for anybody that's left.
- But...

54
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:10,323
You find 'em, you take 'em
to the safety shelters.

55
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:12,925
- I'm really looking forward to...
- That's not my job.

56
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,429
It is today.
Get your ass out there.

57
00:09:16,462 --> 00:09:17,864
Good luck.

58
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,649
Okay. I'll wait for you outside.

59
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:42,822
Fuck.

60
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,328
Hey.

61
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:51,797
We're going to get you
those burgers, huh?

62
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:02,708
Hey, man. Do you mind
leaving some for the rest of us?

63
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:05,278
Excuse me?

64
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:06,846
You took all the meat.

65
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:10,383
Oh, God.

66
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:15,788
Come on, man.
Need just some meat for my kid.

67
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:18,457
What do you wanna do, man, huh?

68
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,326
You wanna fight me
in front of your kid?

69
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:25,831
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

70
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,967
That man just grabbed
a pack of ground beef

71
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,268
right out of my son's hand.

72
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:30,736
What?
What are you talking about?

73
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:34,006
What?

74
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,843
Sir, I'm gonna have to take
your cart and ask you to leave.

75
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:46,252
Whoa, whoa!

76
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,069
Any advice?

77
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:06,105
About?

78
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:09,008
This precinct.
The residents.

79
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,944
Oh. Don't trust 'em.

80
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:14,447
But... that applies everywhere.

81
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,485
Not just the places, um,
don't speak the fucking language.

82
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,221
Oh, yeah?

83
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:26,092
Well, uh, I'm actually trying
to transfer into this house.

84
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:30,029
Or Rio Píedras, I don't know.
Something with more action.

85
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:33,099
- Yeah.
- It's slow as hell up in Zone Two.

86
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,068
That's why I volunteered today.

87
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:41,874
- Okay.
- Okay.

88
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:44,076
So how are we gonna play this?

89
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,378
Play what?

90
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:49,382
What if people refuse to leave?

91
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:53,386
Well, then they die
horrible fucking deaths.

92
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:56,989
But this good news is,
is it ain't our fault.

93
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:00,026
We're not picking anyone up.

94
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:07,099
- Yeah, but, uh, Lt. Cunningham said that we have to...
- Okay, okay, okay.

95
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:11,003
Let's just say that we go out
and we grab a guy, right?

96
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:14,240
He doesn't wanna leave.
He wants your name,

97
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:17,176
he wants your badge number
to file a complaint.

98
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:19,345
Yeah, let him.
I'm doing my job.

99
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:21,180
Oh, like, that matters?

100
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:24,417
You want a transfer
or a promotion,

101
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,020
and the bosses, they're gonna
look at your record, right?

102
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:30,256
Oh, see you got a complaint.

103
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,592
Could be bullshit.
Doesn't matter.

104
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:36,195
You wash your hands at the sink
and you get splash back,

105
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,431
it still looks like
you pissed yourself.

106
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:42,201
Okay. So we're doing nothing?

107
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,603
That's the idea.

108
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,238
Maybe we'll get
some donuts later.

109
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:55,649
<i>10-52,
Plaza del mercado de Rio Píedras.</i>

110
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:57,083
Don't.

111
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,357
Show sector Adam, Boy,
Charlie responding.

112
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:10,062
All right.

113
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,568
You insist.

114
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,375
All righty then.

115
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:26,479
What happened?

116
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:36,322
Um, he was trying to clear out
the meat section,

117
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,057
and he got into a fight
with a customer.

118
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,027
Mm... clear out
the meat section.

119
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:43,429
What, the entire section?

120
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:46,565
Is there a law against
how much meat I can buy?

121
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,603
Sure isn't, but how much meat
were you trying to buy?

122
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,470
Just for the record.

123
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:55,541
- A hundred pounds.
- Oh, wow.

124
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:57,611
- Quite the party.
- Yeah, that's a lot of meat.

125
00:13:57,644 --> 00:13:59,111
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

126
00:13:59,145 --> 00:14:01,514
Uh, where's the victim?

127
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:09,455
Guy left.
Didn't wanna press charges.

128
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:12,224
All he wanted was to make
hamburgers for his little kid.

129
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:14,527
- Well, that's adorable.
- See, the guy didn't wanna press charges.

130
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,962
Y'all gonna let me go, right?

131
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:21,967
Yeah, well, you tell me what you need
all that meat for, I'll consider it.

132
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,109
Huh...

133
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:34,213
That... is a little suspicious.

134
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:35,448
Let's go.

135
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:39,619
Let's go.

136
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:41,554
- Y'all arresting me?
- No.

137
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:42,988
We're putting you
on a bus to a shelters.

138
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:44,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

139
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:46,258
- Y'all can't do that.
- No?

140
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,595
- I'm pretty sure we can.
- I have to stop past my place.

141
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:51,564
- Yeah?
- Yo, officer, I'm being serious.

142
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:55,301
- This is very important.
- No.

143
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,403
Are you just gonna give me
one-word answers?

144
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:59,238
- Maybe.
- All right. Let's go.

145
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,774
- You know what, fuck you.
- Oh, no.

146
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:02,041
- Fuck you, too.
- Oh, yeah?

147
00:15:02,074 --> 00:15:03,242
- Fuck you.
- You walk...

148
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:06,145
Whoa!
That escalated quickly.

149
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:10,182
Yo, officer,
I got some people at my place

150
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:12,384
- that are refusing to leave.
- Yeah, who?

151
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:14,654
Well, there's this old guy
who never leaves.

152
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:17,122
And a cop.
One of you guys.

153
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:19,091
How do you know
they don't wanna leave?

154
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:20,727
Well, the old guy,
he never leaves.

155
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,795
And the cop was just bragging

156
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:23,597
about how he wasn't
going nowhere.

157
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:27,399
Look, I have a pet. That's why
I'm here at the supermarket.

158
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,168
- You have a pet?
- Yeah.

159
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:32,238
- What kind of pet?
- A hungry one.

160
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:33,339
Uh-huh. What's its name?

161
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:34,808
Her name is Janet.

162
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:37,510
Yeah, I don't... I don't like that.

163
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:40,012
Well, Janet doesn't like cops.
Look, guys...

164
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:46,218
Y'all can arrest me,
do whatever the hell you wanna do.

165
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:49,121
But I need to see her and get
her some water before the storm.

166
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,156
Please.

167
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,561
You said there's a cop
that won't leave?

168
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:56,796
Yeah.

169
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,734
All right.
Let's go feed your fuckin' cat.

170
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:19,586
That the super?

171
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:21,520
Yeah.

172
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:24,356
Yeah, that's him.

173
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,134
- What's your name?
- Luillo.

174
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:39,104
Alright, Louie Joe. This guy says you got
residents that are refusing to evacuate.

175
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:42,842
- That's right.
- He said you got a retired cop and an old guy.

176
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,345
- Old guy in 15E.
- And the cop?

177
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:49,081
Barrett, 53B.

178
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:51,483
All right, let's grab Barrett,

179
00:16:51,517 --> 00:16:53,687
and then we'll swing back down
and grab the old guy, okay?

180
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,622
- Okay.
- You gonna let me feed Janet?

181
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:58,290
- What apartment you in?
- Thirty-three-B.

182
00:16:58,324 --> 00:17:00,159
- Is that true?
- Yes.

183
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,629
All right, do it quick.
We'll grab you in five minutes, alright?

184
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:06,098
Fine. Gracias...

185
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,305
Does that say "out of order"?

186
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,175
- What is that?
- <i>Si.</i>

187
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,310
- <i>Si.</i>
- <i>Si. Si.</i>

188
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:19,345
Perfect.

189
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:24,718
Alright.

190
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,886
You know,
you should learn some Spanish.

191
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,689
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're in Puerto Rico.

192
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:33,760
- Yeah.
- That's how we say it. Puerto Rico.

193
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:50,677
Can you get them
to fuck off?

194
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,345
We're evacuating the building.

195
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:56,950
We're evacuating the building.

196
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:58,752
Thank God.
I need your help.

197
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:00,552
Look, even the PD's
taking this seriously.

198
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:02,589
Yeah, current PD's
full of pussies.

199
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,758
Care more about
liability and politics.

200
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,358
I'm staying here.
I'm not leaving.

201
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:08,160
I'm not going anywhere.

202
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:12,766
You gonna take that risk?

203
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,968
Well, Hurricane Irene

204
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,937
started like this,
came to nothing.

205
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,239
She wants to take me
to Centro Medico.

206
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:23,275
That third-rate shithole.
I mean, that's death depot.

207
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:24,944
We used to take OD cases there.

208
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,946
I don't recall seeing
any of them ever again.

209
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:32,585
Well, unfortunately, sir,
it's either that or the evac bus.

210
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:36,388
Excuse me, senorita.

211
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:37,423
You all right there?

212
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:39,491
You worked in Rio Píedras?

213
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,928
Yeah, I used to run that house.

214
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:44,196
Do I know you?

215
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,866
I know you.

216
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,002
'Cause I just put in
a transfer there.

217
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:52,438
Is that right?
Where do I know you from?

218
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:53,573
I know you.

219
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:03,549
- I know you from someplace.
- Uh... from this evac.

220
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,351
- Sir, can we get your stuff?
- Yeah, let's get going.

221
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:07,987
You're Cardillo.

222
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,622
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, Cardillo.

223
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:11,758
You had that thing
about a year ago, right?

224
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:15,327
Yeah?
How'd it go down?

225
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:21,668
It got me down here.
Don't worry about it.

226
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:23,703
I'm not worried about it..

227
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:28,474
They catch the guy
that made the call?

228
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:33,312
Eventually, yeah.

229
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:34,681
Yeah?
Did you beat his ass?

230
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,515
- Dad...
- Did I what?

231
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:37,650
Did you beat his ass?

232
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:38,818
Hey, back in my day

233
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:40,887
we had this moron called
Willie Bosket.

234
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,990
He used to call the stationhouse
to report a rape or a robbery.

235
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:47,827
We'd all rush down there, the guy'd be
on the roof with a BB gun, sniping us.

236
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:50,395
About the third around we caught
him and broke a few fingers.

237
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:53,532
- Nice, Dad. That's real nice.
- Hey, it stopped him. Okay?

238
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:56,803
- Yep.
- Hey, the other cop, the partner.

239
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:59,505
That was your girl, right?

240
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:10,549
Troy, honey, uh, I think
I like my odds better here.

241
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,086
I'm a stubborn asshole,
she takes after me.

242
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,788
I'm standing right here,
you know what I mean?

243
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:16,956
Hey, what do you think
I got fuckin' Alzheimer's...?

244
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,392
It's a Category 5 fuckin' hurricane goin'
on outside, and you forgot about that.

245
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:22,095
You think it's a five already?

246
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,330
Hey, lay it out for me.
How did it go down?

247
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:26,666
Tell me.

248
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:30,036
Alright, I'm gonna go
grab the other old guy.

249
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,071
- Sir, I highly advise...
- Other old guy?

250
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,439
- ...that you go with your daughter.
- Yes, thank you.

251
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:35,809
Or in this case,
your guardian.

252
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:37,010
- Oh, a fuckin' comedian, yeah.

253
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:38,878
And it's only out
of respect for the badge

254
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:41,948
that you're not on a 51-50 hold,
face down on the ground,

255
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:43,583
- hog-tied and fuckin' cuffed...
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

256
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,384
What, you gonna shoot me, too?

257
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,820
Okay, you hear me,
you crazy old fuck?!

258
00:20:46,853 --> 00:20:50,355
- Shut the fuck up!
- You cop-killing cocksucker!

259
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:51,791
- Hey!
- Where you goin?

260
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:52,992
- Where you goin'?
- You stay!

261
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:54,393
Yeah, and don't go
with that guy.

262
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,728
Not without a
bulletproof vest.

263
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:57,764
Honestly, you are
so fuckin' stubborn.

264
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,836
This guy's your fuckin' partner?

265
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,070
Yep.

266
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,372
You're a very brave girl.

267
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:09,642
Hey, hey! What are you...

268
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:12,145
What are you doing?
You're just gonna leave?

269
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,546
Your dad doesn't
wanna leave, ma'am.

270
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:16,381
I can't force him.

271
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:18,383
Isn't that what
you're here for?

272
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:20,687
What do you want me to do?

273
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,055
Do you want me
to carry him down?

274
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:24,023
Hey, you know what,
I don't care what you do.

275
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,125
He needs his dialysis machine,

276
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,629
but once the storm knocks
the power out in this building,

277
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:30,562
nothing's going to work.

278
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:32,899
No machine is gonna work.

279
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:35,001
I have a bed for him
reserved at the hospital,

280
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:37,637
but if we don't get there soon,
we lose it.

281
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,041
You really a doctor?

282
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,614
No, I just like wearing
pajamas all day.

283
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:50,016
Look, all I'm asking you to do,
is to go back in there with me,

284
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,819
and help me get him the fuck out
of this building.

285
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,022
Well, Officer Pena's
with him, okay.

286
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:58,925
She'll take him down.

287
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,595
He doesn't exactly respond
to female authority.

288
00:22:09,135 --> 00:22:10,770
Alright.

289
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:12,571
You know this old guy, right?

290
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:18,211
Yeah, I've seen him around.

291
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:21,546
Do me a favor,
and help me with him.

292
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:23,149
And once we get him out
we'll come back up,

293
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:25,151
and we'll grab your father.
Okay?

294
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:30,924
Alright. Come on.

295
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:38,530
Around the corner to the left.

296
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,133
Down there.

297
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,001
Straight ahead.

298
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,541
This guy always have
this much security?

299
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:51,510
Not that I recall.
Sir?

300
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,079
Hello, sir, it's Troy Barrett.

301
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:54,747
You know my father, Ray.

302
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:57,684
Hello, sir.

303
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,521
What can I help you with?

304
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:03,957
You need to come with us, sir.

305
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,725
No, I cannot leave.

306
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:07,660
You're gonna be
flooded out here if you stay,

307
00:23:07,694 --> 00:23:10,495
you're on the first floor.
It's too dangerous.

308
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:13,967
Has your father left?

309
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,069
We're gonna evacuate him
right after you.

310
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:17,770
Cardillo to Pena.

311
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:19,672
The sooner you come with me...
We're gonna get him,

312
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:20,873
we're gonna get everyone
safe out of the building.

313
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:22,809
Pena, are you there?

314
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:33,086
Cardillo, you copy?

315
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,254
Crickets, huh?

316
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,157
All your comms
are down in this shit.

317
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:42,929
Hey, listen, sweetheart.
You don't need to babysit me, okay.

318
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:52,205
So you ran Rio Píedras, huh?

319
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:54,774
Yeah, you're not leaving.
Okay.

320
00:23:54,807 --> 00:23:56,609
Okay, you don't take a hint,
do ya?

321
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:59,012
I'll be clearer. You can go now.
Thank you. It's...

322
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:01,114
- So...
- I'm good, thank you.

323
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:04,884
I'm trying to transfer into that
house, but it's being held up.

324
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:10,089
So... you think
you can put in... a word for me?

325
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:19,932
Pena, do you copy?

326
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:22,101
I know it feels safer
to stay here,

327
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:23,803
but we gotta
get to higher ground.

328
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:25,204
You cannot park there!

329
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:27,907
I'm safer here, I'm safer here.
I'm not leaving.

330
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,109
I cannot leave my home.

331
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:35,214
Hey! Hey!
You can park back there.

332
00:24:37,216 --> 00:24:38,951
Keep it moving!

333
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:41,287
Get out!

334
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,856
You cannot park there!

335
00:24:44,757 --> 00:24:46,292
I'll take care of this.

336
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:54,600
What is it with the stubborn
bastards in this building?

337
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:56,936
- You have to come with us.
- I'm sorry, I'm not going.

338
00:24:56,969 --> 00:24:58,671
Officer!

339
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:00,940
- Hold on just a second. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

340
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:04,177
- So you can go.
- No, this is an evacuation.

341
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:07,046
Please, just go.

342
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,915
They are closing the roads.

343
00:25:08,948 --> 00:25:12,285
Please, keep going.
Come on, man.

344
00:25:12,318 --> 00:25:16,823
Take it easy. Take it easy...

345
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,938
Let's go! Let's go!
We gotta go now!

346
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:33,272
- You alright?
- Why?

347
00:25:33,306 --> 00:25:35,241
We've gotta go right now.
Come on! Come on!

348
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:37,944
Right now!

349
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:41,881
Okay. Come here.

350
00:25:41,914 --> 00:25:43,716
Come on! Quick, quick!

351
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:46,285
Ernesto...

352
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:57,230
It's a fucking cop!

353
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:01,234
No, no, no. Don't shoot.

354
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,969
You might hit the old man.

355
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:07,173
Migs, you need to
catch up with them.

356
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:08,374
Top floor.

357
00:26:11,077 --> 00:26:13,312
- Who the hell were those guys?
- I have no idea.

358
00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:14,814
We have to
get back to my dad.

359
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:16,215
No, it's too far.
We won't make it.

360
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:17,383
They'll see us.

361
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,118
Well, then where are we going?

362
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:20,186
Up.

363
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:22,955
Come... Come on. Come on.

364
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,895
What are we gonna do
about the fucking cop?

365
00:26:28,928 --> 00:26:31,130
Don't get excited.
They're trapped.

366
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:33,032
Those stairs only lead up

367
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:35,134
and the only exit
is on this floor.

368
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:37,970
Dillon, start your way on top
and work your way down.

369
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:40,973
Pride, Ernesto,
you two guard the front door.

370
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:44,043
Nobody gets in.
Nobody gets out.

371
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:45,311
Okay? Go.

372
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:57,823
Let's go.

373
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:02,862
Janet! I'm sorry, baby.
I'm coming.

374
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:04,730
I got caught up
in the supermarket.

375
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:08,501
Alright. Here we go.

376
00:27:08,534 --> 00:27:11,270
I know, I know, I know, I know.

377
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:14,974
Open the door, right now!

378
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:17,143
Open the door.

379
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,812
I'll meet you downstairs.

380
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:22,148
Open the door, Griffin.

381
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:24,884
Griffin, open the door!

382
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:26,252
You gotta let us in, right now.

383
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,753
Fuck that!

384
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,456
How I know you're not
setting me up?

385
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,760
Back, back, back...

386
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:36,229
Griffin,
you think this is a trap?

387
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:37,930
I let you go earlier.

388
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:40,800
Listen, I've got Troy and your
downstairs neighbor here.

389
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:44,170
You don't understand right now. We are gonna
get our motherfuckin' heads blown off!

390
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:49,976
Open the door.

391
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:51,377
Shit.

392
00:27:54,947 --> 00:27:56,148
We on the same side?

393
00:27:56,182 --> 00:27:58,017
Hey, do me a favor, alright?

394
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,252
Put your ear to the door.

395
00:27:59,285 --> 00:28:01,120
I'm gonna tell you something.

396
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:03,422
- Put your ear to the door!
- My ear's to the goddamn door!

397
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,391
Okay.

398
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:09,195
Open the fucking door!

399
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:19,405
Central, 10-13.

400
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,341
Shots fired.
Okay...

401
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,943
Who's killing who?

402
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:25,411
- Just quiet down. Be quiet.
- No you quiet down!

403
00:28:25,444 --> 00:28:26,812
You in my house.

404
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:28,047
Shots fired at...
What's the address here?

405
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,149
- Six... sixty-five...
- Six-five-eight.

406
00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:31,217
Six-five-eight...

407
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,323
Fuck! Land line.
I need a land line.

408
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:39,492
- Do you have a land line?
- Sorry, man, I didn't get the fuckin' bundle.

409
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:41,360
- Who the fuck's got a land line, man?
- Oh, fuck.

410
00:28:41,394 --> 00:28:43,362
You know, you guys
bust into my place

411
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:45,965
without any consideration.
I don't give a fuck who shot who.

412
00:28:45,998 --> 00:28:48,000
Super Louie Joe...

413
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:50,069
Well, he's super fucking dead,
okay!

414
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,275
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

415
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:00,614
Give me that bowl of food!

416
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:03,349
- What?
- Give me that bowl of food!

417
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:05,217
- What food?
- Give me the bowl of food!

418
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:07,520
- What?
- Give me that bowl of food!

419
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:14,193
Help!

420
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,200
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- What?

421
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,268
Don't shoot.

422
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,603
Don't shoot?

423
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,005
Just bring me that bowl of food.

424
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:29,275
- What?
- Bring me the bowl of food!

425
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:31,944
It's right behind you.
Bring me the bowl of food.

426
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:35,014
Okay...

427
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:43,422
Oh, my God.

428
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:48,961
What the fuck?

429
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:52,965
Stop, stop...

430
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:56,502
- What?
- Take off your uniform.

431
00:29:56,535 --> 00:29:58,337
Take off my fucking uniform?

432
00:29:58,371 --> 00:30:01,474
Yeah. She hates cops.
I trained her.

433
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:03,442
If you don't want her
to bite your fuckin' ass

434
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:05,144
take your uniform off.

435
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:20,159
Okay.
Tell me your story.

436
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:21,460
What do you mean?
What kind of story?

437
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:23,129
A Disney story.
What do you think?

438
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:25,632
I want your story.
Like your best collar.

439
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:28,901
If you want a rec,
you gotta gimme something to work with.

440
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:35,541
There was a warrant out on a murder
suspect about five months back.

441
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:39,412
I'm on patrol driving by the
Burger King off Avenida Ashford.

442
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:42,448
And see a guy
in the parking lot.

443
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:45,985
Six-two, 160, long hair.

444
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,453
We park and approach.

445
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:51,123
But as I'm getting closer,
I realize it's not the guy.

446
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:02,301
Slow. Nothing too quick.

447
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:04,604
Oh, my God.

448
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:07,239
Alright,
now you gonna grab my hand.

449
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:08,340
Alright.

450
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:09,643
And when I say,

451
00:31:09,676 --> 00:31:11,076
pull me out as fast as you can.

452
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,344
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

453
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:14,748
- Alright.
- Okay, here we go. Okay.

454
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:16,081
Go!

455
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:17,684
Close the door!

456
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:18,718
Close the door!
Close the door!

457
00:31:22,188 --> 00:31:23,989
What the fuck is that?!

458
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:26,392
Oh, shit.

459
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:28,695
I lost them.

460
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:30,630
You lost them?

461
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:32,565
They gotta be somewhere
around in the building.

462
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,201
- There's no other way out.
- No. Shut the fuck up.

463
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:36,569
Alright? No excuses!

464
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:42,308
Okay? Go find them.
Now, go!

465
00:31:58,825 --> 00:32:01,393
And that's your fucking pet?

466
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:05,164
Fucking got a killing machine
for a fucking service animal.

467
00:32:05,197 --> 00:32:06,700
Okay, we got a problem.

468
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:09,134
What kinda
bedside manner talk is this?

469
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:11,136
"We got a problem."
You don't wanna ease me in?

470
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,038
Uh.. could really use a saw.

471
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:17,276
Yeah, this would be a great
point for an amputate.

472
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:18,812
No, you're not
cutting my leg off!

473
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:20,747
We didn't have time
to ease you in.

474
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,214
What do you need?

475
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:24,383
Uh, a splint
to secure the femur.

476
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:27,754
Anti-septic, penicillin,
gauze, stitches.

477
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:30,757
I know a doctor.

478
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,225
Congratulations.

479
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:35,461
He's here in the building.

480
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:38,197
- Dr. Berman.
- Yeah, what apartment? Where?

481
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,400
It's uh... 63B.

482
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:43,202
Shit...

483
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:46,405
Alright, I'll go get that stuff.

484
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:48,340
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No, no, you gotta stay here with him...

485
00:32:48,374 --> 00:32:50,276
No, I'll come with you.
The sooner we take care of this,

486
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:52,244
the sooner I can
get back to my father.

487
00:32:52,746 --> 00:32:53,847
Alright.

488
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,615
Hey, come over here.
Come here.

489
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:57,249
Come, I need your help.

490
00:32:57,283 --> 00:32:58,752
I need you to take
both your hands

491
00:32:58,785 --> 00:33:01,320
and apply pressure
to this wound, okay. Hard.

492
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:05,524
Talk to him, keep him awake.
It's just as important

493
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:07,259
as applying pressure
to the wound. You got it?

494
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:09,228
Okay.

495
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:10,864
- Griffin...
- Hm?

496
00:33:10,897 --> 00:33:13,232
There any back stairs?
Alternate routes up?

497
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:15,602
There's only one set of stairs.

498
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:17,303
And the elevator,
but the elevator's out.

499
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:18,705
Yeah, of course it is.

500
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:20,439
But there's another way.

501
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,776
Scaffolding.

502
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,314
Scaffolding.

503
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,288
So... Oh, yeah... the guy
we're looking for has tats

504
00:33:36,322 --> 00:33:37,456
and this guy's clean.

505
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:41,695
But something was off.
He looks nervous.

506
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:44,764
My radar starts going off

507
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:46,365
and that's when I see it.

508
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:48,635
What?

509
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:52,338
A giant bulge
sticking out of his...

510
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:55,441
- you know...
- What, his crotch? What?

511
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:59,345
No, his ass.

512
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:01,246
I see the top
of a plastic baggie

513
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,182
sticking out the top
of his pants.

514
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,351
I ask him what it is,
he goes nuts.

515
00:34:05,384 --> 00:34:08,220
We cuff him, took him back
to the stationhouse,

516
00:34:08,253 --> 00:34:09,455
and when we strip search him

517
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:13,827
we find 93 baggies
of crack cocaine.

518
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,831
Biggest narcotics collar
that month.

519
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:20,199
- Biggest.
- Wow.

520
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:23,603
So what you're telling me is you
stumble onto a narcotics collar,

521
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:28,642
oh, because some moron had a family-sized
baggie sticking out of his ass?

522
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,342
That's your best collar?

523
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,847
You didn't even have
probable cause.

524
00:34:39,318 --> 00:34:41,855
- Never mind.
- No, you know, I'm just saying.

525
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:43,657
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They should be done by now.

526
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,491
I'm...
I'm gonna go check on them.

527
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:47,493
- Yeah...
- Yeah, you can do...

528
00:34:47,526 --> 00:34:49,763
You can do, you know, whatever.

529
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:52,866
I'm such an asshole.

530
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:57,369
- You got it?
- Yeah.

531
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:11,785
So, two flights up
and three units over.

532
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,218
Yeah.
Are you a good shot?

533
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:16,321
Yeah, why?

534
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:17,791
Do me a favor.

535
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,859
If I fall, shoot me.

536
00:35:19,893 --> 00:35:23,462
I don't wanna wait four-and-a-half
hours to die of a brain hemorrhage.

537
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:24,731
Yeah, what if I fall?

538
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:27,767
You're a hard-headed.
You'll survive.

539
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,942
- Ready?
- Blow it.

540
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:04,369
Watch it, sweetheart.

541
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:06,940
Take your hand
off your gun, slowly.

542
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:09,241
Hands in the air.

543
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:12,812
Where are they?

544
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:15,882
Where are who?

545
00:36:15,915 --> 00:36:17,617
Your partner and the old man.

546
00:36:22,021 --> 00:36:23,388
Follow me.

547
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:25,658
- I'll show you.
- Go.

548
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:30,029
Better not be fucking with me.

549
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:33,800
Come on.

550
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:39,939
Hey! You mind pointing
that gun somewhere else?

551
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:41,373
Hey, shut the fuck up.

552
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:43,977
Is this it?

553
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:46,646
This is it.

554
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:49,682
You go first.

555
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:51,450
If this is a fucking ambush,

556
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:53,418
I swear to God,
I will fucking kill you.

557
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:55,487
Hey, asshole!

558
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:03,596
Oh, yeah. Come on, now,
help me drag him inside.

559
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,065
He's a heavy motherfucker.

560
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,500
Yeah, come on.
Come on, buddy.

561
00:37:14,373 --> 00:37:15,507
Boss!

562
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:35,427
Get down there.
I'll go check on Chaz, bro.

563
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:45,972
Don't worry.
She won't break through.

564
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,911
What's your name?

565
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,015
Paul.

566
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:57,917
Paul...

567
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,588
What's the accent?

568
00:38:02,622 --> 00:38:04,023
German?

569
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:06,693
- German, yes.
- Mm-hm.

570
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,662
I'm Jason.

571
00:38:09,696 --> 00:38:11,130
I'd offer to shake your hand,

572
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,432
but I really need you
to keep pushing down.

573
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,668
Of course.

574
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:01,080
Give me the gun.

575
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,045
Oh, shit.

576
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,253
Hey, it'll be okay.

577
00:39:40,286 --> 00:39:42,221
Yeah...

578
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:48,094
They're on the fourth floor,
heading up.

579
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:50,596
- Where's Ernesto?
- He's dead.

580
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,966
Bigger splits
for the rest of us.

581
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:01,708
Ah...
You recognize the name?

582
00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:04,010
Alexander Dillon.
No.

583
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:05,544
No, should I?

584
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:07,647
You want to work the good cases,

585
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,215
you gotta know the players.

586
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:12,685
- Who is he?
- He's part of a crew.

587
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,022
He does high end heist jobs:
jewelry, museums, armored trucks.

588
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:20,893
The shot caller's
a real psycho piece of shit.

589
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:23,062
Calls himself John the Baptist.

590
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:25,631
I got a buddy downtown,
a lieutenant I trained,

591
00:40:25,665 --> 00:40:27,600
he works the major
crime zone three.

592
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:32,271
He's been chasing these clowns for a...
for a month.

593
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,207
You okay?
Are you alright?

594
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,275
Yeah. Hey...
Can you do me a favor?

595
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,211
Get my pills.

596
00:40:38,244 --> 00:40:40,646
Oxy, oxy...
whatever the fuck you call it.

597
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,648
I can't pronounce it.
Uh, not that room.

598
00:40:42,682 --> 00:40:45,018
The next door down.
That's my wife's art studio.

599
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:46,786
The next door down
is the bathroom.

600
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:51,858
So did you read the paper?

601
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:54,327
Today? No. No, why?

602
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,031
So this crew targets
this blue-haired old bag.

603
00:40:58,064 --> 00:41:00,633
But the bop the old girl before
they could finish the job,

604
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,001
the greedy fuckers.

605
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:03,136
That was this guy Dillon?

606
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,104
It's empty, by the way.

607
00:41:05,138 --> 00:41:07,607
Ah, yeah, thanks.
This guy? Yeah.

608
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,175
My buddy thinks
he's one of them, yeah.

609
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:12,178
I haven't worn this in 15 years.

610
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:14,113
What if it still fits?

611
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:16,049
What... what do you think
these guys want?

612
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:17,283
Yeah...

613
00:41:18,384 --> 00:41:20,753
I might have a pretty good idea.

614
00:41:20,787 --> 00:41:24,323
But if you're trying to make
an impression, now's the time.

615
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:25,358
Let's go.

616
00:41:29,996 --> 00:41:33,032
- What apartment is this?
- 44B.

617
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:35,101
All right... up and two over.

618
00:41:37,837 --> 00:41:41,974
She's this woman,
came into the hospital bunch of times.

619
00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:44,911
Claimed cops used to hold her down
and inject rat blood in her eyes.

620
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:47,747
What? Roberta Gradischer?

621
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,116
- You know her?
- Oh, yeah.

622
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:52,351
Wait a second.

623
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:55,588
It was you.

624
00:41:56,956 --> 00:41:58,925
Right? It was you.
That's what my father

625
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,660
was referring to downstairs.

626
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:02,995
Uh.. partially, yeah.

627
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:06,332
Oh, my God.
She used to say it was two cops.

628
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:08,367
- Smith...
- No, Smythe.

629
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,270
Smith and Smythe. Exactly.

630
00:42:11,304 --> 00:42:12,872
Did you treat her?

631
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,408
After four times, I had to
give her an eye dropper.

632
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:17,276
Told her there was
holy water in it.

633
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,880
That's funny. She actually
brought that down to the lab.

634
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,783
She wanted us
to test it for rat poison.

635
00:42:23,816 --> 00:42:27,653
See? She didn't trust me either.

636
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:29,956
She wanted me
to file a police report.

637
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:31,791
On me?

638
00:42:31,824 --> 00:42:35,061
Wait... let me see that.

639
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,796
- Come here.
- Oh, it's not... It's not.

640
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,030
- Come here.
- Oh, it's fine.

641
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:39,398
Come here.

642
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:44,670
- It's a surface wound...
- Yeah, it's fine.

643
00:42:44,704 --> 00:42:48,241
No, it was a police report...
It was for the commissioner.

644
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,209
Yeah, she, uh...

645
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:55,114
She thought that the police
commissioner was stealing her coupons.

646
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:57,049
No... shit.

647
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:59,652
She's fuckin' nuts.

648
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,746
You mind if I ask you something?

649
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:30,816
I mind if you ask permission.
You wanna ask something, just ask.

650
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,753
What the hell did you stay for?

651
00:43:33,786 --> 00:43:35,454
I mean, you had to know
the storm was gonna be bad.

652
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,256
Right?

653
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,862
Do you know what
a fecal transplant is?

654
00:43:42,895 --> 00:43:45,031
- A what?
- A fecal transplant.

655
00:43:45,064 --> 00:43:46,799
It's exactly
what it sounds like.

656
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,303
Doctor takes someone else's
shit, puts it in your body.

657
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,904
- What the hell for?
- Yeah, right.

658
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:53,172
It's good for colitis,
or something.

659
00:43:53,206 --> 00:43:54,507
Troy wants me to do that.

660
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,309
I also got
some other bullshit going on.

661
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,778
Kidneys, lungs...
They're fucked.

662
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:01,080
It's gonna kill me, eventually.
I'm on a million pills.

663
00:44:01,113 --> 00:44:02,815
She takes me to the hospital,
it's over,

664
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,150
and I'm not going out that way.

665
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,253
Jackpot!

666
00:44:11,457 --> 00:44:14,126
So you are or aren't
full of shit?

667
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:17,797
Shut the fuck up.

668
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,935
I ran out of my prescription.

669
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:26,839
- What's that?
- Oxy-moron. It's good for the pain.

670
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,008
- Want one?
- I'm good.

671
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,243
Okay.

672
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,356
Now I'm ready.
Let's go, smartass.

673
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,390
Okay.

674
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:48,995
- Wait, wait, wait...
- What?

675
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:51,964
- Where we going?
- Oh... apartment 44A.

676
00:44:51,998 --> 00:44:54,400
Ex-DEA agent lives there.
He's armed to the teeth.

677
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:56,202
He's like a survivalist.

678
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,237
If we're gonna stand
any kinda chance at all,

679
00:44:58,271 --> 00:45:00,072
we need all the firepower
we can get.

680
00:45:00,106 --> 00:45:01,407
Remember, shoot to kill, kid.

681
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,043
I got your back.
You got mine, alright?

682
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,378
Here we go.

683
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:21,861
Get the fuck in.

684
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:36,809
Fuck.

685
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,316
Drop it.

686
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:46,620
Drop it.

687
00:45:46,653 --> 00:45:48,087
Drop it.

688
00:45:49,488 --> 00:45:50,923
Slowly.

689
00:45:52,558 --> 00:45:53,926
Now toss it.

690
00:45:55,662 --> 00:45:57,897
Come on.

691
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,032
Don't you move
or I'll blow your head off.

692
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,201
Where's the old man?

693
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,538
He's up my ass,
you wanna tickle his feet?

694
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:41,333
Come on.

695
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:43,436
Can't get a shot.

696
00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:38,991
Wow! Oh, good. Come on.

697
00:48:41,193 --> 00:48:43,763
- You shot me!
- Come on!

698
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:47,767
Come on!

699
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:50,704
I couldn't help it.
You were in the way.

700
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,410
Where the hell did they go?
Did you see?

701
00:48:58,444 --> 00:49:00,513
You're kidding me.
I couldn't see anything.

702
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:02,548
You're supposed to be
my eyes, kid.

703
00:49:02,582 --> 00:49:04,183
Okay, watch out.

704
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:06,285
Hey, hey! Don't.
I got a key.

705
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,621
Are you fucking kidding me?

706
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:10,724
This guy's a friendly.
I think it's this one.

707
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:12,324
Yeah, there you go.

708
00:49:14,527 --> 00:49:17,229
Everything I told you, right?
Huh?

709
00:49:17,263 --> 00:49:19,733
One-stop shopping,
ladies and gentlemen.

710
00:49:19,766 --> 00:49:20,767
Holy shit.

711
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,535
Choose your weapon.

712
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:24,236
Take your pick.

713
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,766
You a Nazi?

714
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:01,741
You don't like people like me.

715
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:07,781
Oh, no, I...

716
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:13,218
I don't...
feel that way anymore.

717
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:16,288
I didn't think
there was no Nazis left.

718
00:50:17,857 --> 00:50:20,159
I guess there gotta be some.

719
00:50:20,192 --> 00:50:24,598
But they must be old as shit like your ass.

720
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:44,416
Can you hold this?

721
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,356
Bullet passed
straight to the calf.

722
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:53,760
Tibia, fibula clear.

723
00:50:53,793 --> 00:50:57,764
Lucky me, huh?

724
00:50:57,797 --> 00:51:01,668
No... I'm a good shot.

725
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,207
Yeah...

726
00:51:10,509 --> 00:51:14,213
Yeah, one Thanksgiving,
my dad...

727
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,886
he went out and bought
a bunch of frozen turkeys.

728
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,522
Not for eating them.

729
00:51:23,555 --> 00:51:26,660
But he brought them home to just
shoot the fuck out of them all.

730
00:51:26,693 --> 00:51:28,862
Just filled those birds
up with lead.

731
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,930
Just...

732
00:51:31,865 --> 00:51:34,668
Target practice.

733
00:51:37,503 --> 00:51:39,673
And I was really excited,
'cause...

734
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,842
I always wanted to be a doctor.

735
00:51:43,877 --> 00:51:46,613
And I loved it 'cause...

736
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:49,548
I got to pick all the bullets
out of the birds and...

737
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:52,619
stitch up all the holes.

738
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,353
Wow.

739
00:51:56,555 --> 00:51:59,926
So what were you and my dad
really talking about downstairs?

740
00:52:06,398 --> 00:52:07,634
Well...

741
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:19,511
I used to be on the detective
squad out in New York.

742
00:52:20,312 --> 00:52:22,015
Real busy.

743
00:52:22,048 --> 00:52:25,484
Never a down moment.
I loved it.

744
00:52:26,886 --> 00:52:30,990
And, uh, I hear a call
for a gun run one night.

745
00:52:31,024 --> 00:52:36,495
And, uh, I'm close,
like four blocks away.

746
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:40,600
<i>I don't even hesitate.
Take it.</i>

747
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:42,267
<i>But I'm with Jasmine.</i>

748
00:52:42,836 --> 00:52:45,437
Uh, she's my, um...

749
00:52:47,907 --> 00:52:49,341
I get it.

750
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:57,951
That's actually
just down the way from here.

751
00:52:57,984 --> 00:52:59,953
Come on, baby, please...

752
00:52:59,986 --> 00:53:02,756
<i>She asked me</i>
<i>not to take the call.</i>

753
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:07,459
<i>Jasmine was a cop, too,</i>

754
00:53:09,596 --> 00:53:12,799
But I told her, you know,
stay in the car at home.

755
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:15,702
<i>And to call for backup.</i>

756
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:17,771
I'll take care of it.

757
00:53:22,108 --> 00:53:24,010
So I go in there.

758
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:27,412
<i>I see a barrel.</i>

759
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:32,852
I amped up,
I squeeze the trigger...

760
00:53:37,556 --> 00:53:39,626
<i>And I'm just...</i>

761
00:53:43,897 --> 00:53:45,430
Jasmine.

762
00:53:49,903 --> 00:53:51,871
Where was the guy with the gun?

763
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:55,440
There was no gun.

764
00:53:55,474 --> 00:53:56,876
Hey!

765
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,678
- You call this in?
- Yeah.

766
00:53:58,711 --> 00:54:00,412
You have any weapons?
I'm gonna search...

767
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,415
<i>This asshole just
called in a fake gun run</i>

768
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:08,021
'cause he figured that we were taking too
long to respond to his noise complaint.

769
00:54:12,058 --> 00:54:13,760
That's not on you,
you know that.

770
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:16,930
I know.

771
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:21,333
But it happened to me,
you know.

772
00:54:26,405 --> 00:54:28,507
I put her in that position.

773
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,583
I always said I'd never
hook up with a cop.

774
00:54:38,585 --> 00:54:40,954
What, why?
Because of your father?

775
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:43,723
Yeah, I'm not really that
into kissing my dad, you know.

776
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:46,626
Well, daddy issues, huh?

777
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:57,369
He always wanted a boy.

778
00:55:04,911 --> 00:55:06,411
Troy.

779
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,850
You really believe that?

780
00:55:14,486 --> 00:55:15,788
You met him.

781
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:19,558
I did. Yeah.

782
00:55:19,592 --> 00:55:22,061
He's a fucking asshole, but...

783
00:55:22,095 --> 00:55:25,464
I also met you...

784
00:55:25,497 --> 00:55:27,901
and I'm pretty sure
he doesn't think that.

785
00:55:41,848 --> 00:55:43,116
Well done.

786
00:55:45,752 --> 00:55:48,988
We'll have you back like
you've never been shot before.

787
00:55:49,022 --> 00:55:51,791
God, you got the touch, Doc.

788
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:55,494
Alright.

789
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:58,765
- You're good.
- Thank you.

790
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,809
When we, uh, get out of here...

791
00:56:09,842 --> 00:56:11,177
do you, um...

792
00:56:12,544 --> 00:56:15,114
be open to...

793
00:56:15,148 --> 00:56:18,217
you know, helping me
take these stitches out.

794
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:19,953
I'm gonna need 'em out for sure.

795
00:56:19,986 --> 00:56:22,822
No, no, I'm... I'm serious.
Like, uh...

796
00:56:22,855 --> 00:56:26,092
I'm... I'm very particular
when it comes to making sure

797
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:27,894
I get my stitches out
and all that.

798
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:31,164
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, needles and such.

799
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:35,068
Well, I am particularly
good at that.

800
00:56:35,868 --> 00:56:37,502
I appreciate that.

801
00:56:38,805 --> 00:56:40,173
Anytime.

802
00:56:55,321 --> 00:56:57,824
Boss, you gotta see this.

803
00:57:04,831 --> 00:57:06,531
Ah, that looks nice.

804
00:57:06,565 --> 00:57:08,301
Nice Uzi, that's a good one.

805
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:11,536
Have one of these.
This could be handy.

806
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:13,106
I like this little baby, here.

807
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:15,108
Don't you want an M4,
maybe a shotgun?

808
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:16,743
Don't fucking move!

809
00:57:16,776 --> 00:57:18,711
Whoa, okay.

810
00:57:21,681 --> 00:57:23,783
So this is the spot?

811
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,818
Why, you asking us
or telling us?

812
00:57:25,852 --> 00:57:27,687
I'm asking, fuck-face.

813
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,922
I'm just trying
to clarify is all.

814
00:57:29,956 --> 00:57:31,224
Yes...

815
00:57:33,593 --> 00:57:34,961
This is the spot.

816
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,198
Put your weapons on the floor.

817
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:41,167
All right, nice and slow now.

818
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,069
Make the man happy, sweetheart.

819
00:57:43,903 --> 00:57:44,937
Arms... arms up.

820
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:47,040
Weapons on the floor, that's it.

821
00:57:47,073 --> 00:57:48,641
Nice and calm now.

822
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,114
Okay.

823
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,252
Okay?

824
00:58:36,422 --> 00:58:41,060
Ah, fuck. Fuck!

825
00:58:46,966 --> 00:58:48,000
- Hey.
- Hey!

826
00:58:48,034 --> 00:58:49,635
Nice fucking work, kid.

827
00:58:49,669 --> 00:58:51,971
I think I got a spare hole here.

828
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,208
Yeah, fuck.

829
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:56,776
They opened me apart.

830
00:58:56,809 --> 00:58:58,845
Yeah, help me up.
You lie down you die.

831
00:58:58,878 --> 00:59:01,280
Help me up.

832
00:59:01,314 --> 00:59:04,150
Okay. Okay.

833
00:59:04,183 --> 00:59:06,052
It's empty!
It's fucking empty!

834
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:08,754
I know it's fucking empty!
Shut the fuck up!

835
00:59:08,788 --> 00:59:10,857
Okay. The old man
knows where the art is.

836
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,091
We find the old man,
we find the art.

837
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:13,826
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

838
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:20,099
You trained Janet
to attack the police?

839
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,369
Yeah.

840
00:59:24,737 --> 00:59:26,239
Why?

841
00:59:28,474 --> 00:59:31,010
I was walking home from work...

842
00:59:33,746 --> 00:59:35,781
and two cops, they stop me.

843
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,686
Said I match a description
to this robbery.

844
00:59:42,822 --> 00:59:45,091
I know what the description was.

845
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:53,833
Black male... 18 to 40s,
5'6'' to 6'8''.

846
00:59:53,866 --> 00:59:55,434
I've been stopped like 20 times,

847
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:57,770
and I didn't commit any robbery.

848
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:00,072
I was sick of it.

849
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,075
So I kept walking.

850
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,782
Said a few choice words...

851
01:00:11,117 --> 01:00:12,952
pushed off of them.

852
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:19,959
Next thing I knew
I was waking up in the hospital.

853
01:00:21,394 --> 01:00:23,162
But I filed a notice of claim...

854
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:26,866
sued the city...

855
01:00:28,134 --> 01:00:31,037
and got a big ass settlement
and I moved down here.

856
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:34,073
And I rescued Janet.

857
01:00:37,877 --> 01:00:39,912
Feels like dirty money.

858
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:44,016
Like I took something
that ain't belong to me.

859
01:00:45,418 --> 01:00:47,019
You know what I mean?

860
01:00:50,289 --> 01:00:51,791
I do.

861
01:00:56,062 --> 01:00:57,230
I do.

862
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,536
Okay, Ray...

863
01:01:03,569 --> 01:01:05,238
Oh... Oh, that's a hole.

864
01:01:08,941 --> 01:01:10,176
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

865
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:11,844
I'm sorry,
it was my fucking fault.

866
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:12,979
I'm sorry.

867
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,915
I was trying to do something
to give us a shot.

868
01:01:15,948 --> 01:01:18,784
Shut the fuck up!
Jesus.

869
01:01:18,818 --> 01:01:20,319
You did what you had to do,
and you did good.

870
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:22,922
- So hold it, alright?
- I'm sorry.

871
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:24,557
If we get outta this,

872
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:27,326
I'll recommend you
for any damn unit you want.

873
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,998
Except Warrants. Fuck Warrants.

874
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,042
Wow. That hurts.

875
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:45,579
- Are you okay?
- Okay, let's go.

876
01:01:45,612 --> 01:01:47,246
Okay...

877
01:01:56,522 --> 01:01:59,792
We'll go floor by floor
until we find him.

878
01:02:00,393 --> 01:02:02,995
What happened to them?

879
01:02:03,029 --> 01:02:05,031
Well, he's not taking a nap.

880
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:09,201
Alright, you ready?

881
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:12,405
Not really, but,
hey, what else are we gonna do?

882
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:13,539
Where's my vest?

883
01:02:15,074 --> 01:02:17,910
Fat lotta good that did, huh?

884
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,979
They don't make it big enough,
do they?

885
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:22,882
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Yeah.

886
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:24,450
Let's go.

887
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:28,354
Okay...

888
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:47,406
Ray!

889
01:02:50,376 --> 01:02:53,546
Get up! Now! Get up.

890
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:57,516
I'll shoot you in the fucking head.
Get up.

891
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:58,851
Get up!

892
01:03:02,021 --> 01:03:03,322
Move!

893
01:03:24,543 --> 01:03:27,614
Go in there.
In there.

894
01:04:04,116 --> 01:04:05,284
Dad.

895
01:04:07,486 --> 01:04:09,021
- Hey.
- Oh, shit.

896
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:11,190
Hi, sweetie. Hi.

897
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:15,261
I've been looking
for you two all over.

898
01:04:15,294 --> 01:04:16,996
Where you been?

899
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:21,000
Hey, Cardillo, these clowns
are pretty heavy tooled up.

900
01:04:21,033 --> 01:04:22,535
Be careful alright?

901
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:24,470
I'd appreciate it if you could
cap a couple of them, too.

902
01:04:24,503 --> 01:04:26,505
Sons a bitch...

903
01:04:26,539 --> 01:04:28,073
It's okay...

904
01:04:31,544 --> 01:04:32,712
Hey, honey...

905
01:04:32,746 --> 01:04:34,280
Honey, don't.
No, honey, stop.

906
01:04:34,313 --> 01:04:36,315
- Relax.
- I have too many holes in me.

907
01:04:36,348 --> 01:04:38,984
Just sit with me for a sec, huh?

908
01:04:39,018 --> 01:04:40,419
Please, sit with me for a sec.

909
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:49,061
Good shooting.

910
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:54,200
I saw you down there.
Good work.

911
01:04:57,536 --> 01:05:00,105
Hold my hand, darling.
Hold my hand.

912
01:05:00,139 --> 01:05:02,141
Yeah, that's good.

913
01:05:09,783 --> 01:05:11,183
Come here.

914
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,520
We gotta go.

915
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:56,596
Um...

916
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:05,705
I love you, Dad.

917
01:06:40,472 --> 01:06:42,174
Hey...

918
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,410
Will you let me know
how it feels

919
01:06:44,443 --> 01:06:47,246
for a bullet
to go through your skin...

920
01:06:48,514 --> 01:06:50,249
and into your brain?

921
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:56,823
Why don't you go
and fuck yourself?

922
01:07:14,808 --> 01:07:16,776
You know where your partner is?

923
01:07:22,816 --> 01:07:24,618
How about the old man?

924
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:28,688
It was worth a shot.

925
01:07:33,927 --> 01:07:38,564
<i>Adam-Boy-Charlie.
Over. Do you copy?</i>

926
01:07:50,777 --> 01:07:52,579
Is it over?

927
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,584
We're in the eye of the storm.

928
01:08:04,891 --> 01:08:06,291
Open up.

929
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,628
It's safe.

930
01:08:09,696 --> 01:08:10,830
Alright.

931
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:13,800
We need weapons.

932
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:15,769
Guns, knives,
anything that kills.

933
01:08:15,802 --> 01:08:17,871
Hey, we're in the fucking
same boat now, huh...

934
01:08:17,904 --> 01:08:20,607
Yeah...
And your father?

935
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:28,748
It was getting real dark
in here for a minute.

936
01:08:30,784 --> 01:08:32,451
Are you okay?

937
01:08:38,692 --> 01:08:40,960
We should get out of here.

938
01:08:43,963 --> 01:08:47,600
"Poppy Flowers."

939
01:08:47,634 --> 01:08:50,670
Vincent Van Gogh,
$55 million.

940
01:08:50,704 --> 01:08:53,606
It's here in this building.

941
01:08:59,913 --> 01:09:01,848
<i>Officer Cardillo.</i>

942
01:09:05,317 --> 01:09:06,686
This is Cardillo.

943
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:10,422
<i>I'm here with your partner,
Officer Pena.</i>

944
01:09:12,324 --> 01:09:13,727
Is she okay?

945
01:09:15,795 --> 01:09:17,362
Say hello.

946
01:09:18,832 --> 01:09:21,300
I'm okay.
I'm okay, Cardillo.

947
01:09:24,604 --> 01:09:28,775
I'm sure you can see,
we've hit a lull in the storm.

948
01:09:28,808 --> 01:09:32,478
<i>Which gives us about 15 minutes
to finish our business</i>

949
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:33,980
and safely exit.

950
01:09:34,013 --> 01:09:37,416
I would suggest
for Officer Pena's sake,

951
01:09:37,449 --> 01:09:40,452
that you refrain
from calling for back-up.

952
01:09:45,524 --> 01:09:47,259
<i>Officer Cardillo...</i>

953
01:09:50,096 --> 01:09:52,498
I haven't called.

954
01:09:52,531 --> 01:09:55,902
<i>Then I'll keep this simple
for expediency.</i>

955
01:09:55,935 --> 01:10:00,607
<i>I want you,
the old man and the art.</i>

956
01:10:12,018 --> 01:10:13,820
I can't finish this here.

957
01:10:14,921 --> 01:10:17,556
- What is it?
- He's bleeding out.

958
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,626
I gotta get him to a hospital,
now.

959
01:10:20,559 --> 01:10:22,028
<i>Officer?</i>

960
01:10:26,866 --> 01:10:28,902
You can have me and the art...

961
01:10:32,538 --> 01:10:34,774
<i>but you have to release
Officer Pena.</i>

962
01:10:36,743 --> 01:10:39,378
That's so cliché. So cliché.

963
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:41,948
You know, I figured
you were the smart one.

964
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:43,850
Aww...

965
01:10:43,883 --> 01:10:46,451
Come to apartment 44A.

966
01:10:46,986 --> 01:10:48,822
<i>Leave your guns.</i>

967
01:10:48,855 --> 01:10:50,355
If you're not here
in five minutes,

968
01:10:50,389 --> 01:10:51,591
I'll execute your partner

969
01:10:51,624 --> 01:10:53,358
and throw her out
the fucking window.

970
01:10:53,392 --> 01:10:56,729
<i>Don't make the same mistake
you made in New York.</i>

971
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,036
How do you know about that?

972
01:11:03,069 --> 01:11:04,871
I know everything.

973
01:11:05,738 --> 01:11:07,406
I'm John the Baptist.

974
01:11:20,186 --> 01:11:21,754
Where are they?

975
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,159
Where the fuck are they?

976
01:11:26,192 --> 01:11:31,598
- I... I don't know.
- Don't you fucking lie to me.

977
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:36,135
They came here looking for you.

978
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:38,738
Did you hear what
he said they're gonna do?

979
01:11:38,771 --> 01:11:40,840
They're gonna fucking kill Pena,

980
01:11:40,874 --> 01:11:43,810
and then they're gonna
hunt us down.

981
01:11:43,843 --> 01:11:46,012
This storm is gonna
start back up,

982
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:49,182
and then we're gonna be trapped.

983
01:11:49,215 --> 01:11:52,585
They'll be shooting fish
in a fucking barrel.

984
01:12:04,631 --> 01:12:09,468
They have been in my family
since the war.

985
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:13,940
- Are you a Nazi?
- No.

986
01:12:17,644 --> 01:12:19,913
My father was.

987
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:26,451
And he passed
these paintings to me.

988
01:12:29,488 --> 01:12:31,057
That's blood money.

989
01:12:33,726 --> 01:12:35,560
Are they in the building?

990
01:12:36,996 --> 01:12:38,631
Are they in
the fucking building?

991
01:12:38,665 --> 01:12:40,133
Tell him!

992
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:50,043
Two minutes.

993
01:12:54,247 --> 01:12:55,480
Here.

994
01:12:56,082 --> 01:12:57,116
Take this.

995
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:59,118
- Why?
- You're gonna need it.

996
01:12:59,152 --> 01:13:00,720
What about you?

997
01:13:00,753 --> 01:13:02,722
We're gonna go on up there
and finish this.

998
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:05,124
- Okay.
- I know you know how to shoot.

999
01:13:07,827 --> 01:13:10,063
You get out when you can.

1000
01:13:10,096 --> 01:13:11,164
Both of you.

1001
01:13:12,732 --> 01:13:13,733
Hey...

1002
01:13:19,706 --> 01:13:21,741
Don't take the scaffolding.

1003
01:13:26,612 --> 01:13:27,647
Yeah.

1004
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:36,856
All right, buddy.

1005
01:13:36,889 --> 01:13:37,991
Let's go.

1006
01:13:39,025 --> 01:13:40,860
Okay.

1007
01:13:41,594 --> 01:13:42,561
Come on.

1008
01:13:42,595 --> 01:13:43,629
We gotta keep moving.

1009
01:13:43,663 --> 01:13:44,764
Come on.

1010
01:14:15,128 --> 01:14:16,662
One minute.

1011
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:36,949
Where is it?

1012
01:14:36,983 --> 01:14:40,019
- Let her go first.
- I don't think so.

1013
01:14:40,053 --> 01:14:41,687
Where is it?

1014
01:15:08,881 --> 01:15:10,316
C'mon, forward.

1015
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:13,786
Open that door, slowly.

1016
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:18,658
Slowly.

1017
01:15:23,763 --> 01:15:26,032
You moved it all in here, cool?

1018
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:32,338
Ray was the only person
I trusted.

1019
01:15:33,339 --> 01:15:35,141
It's that way.

1020
01:15:46,419 --> 01:15:48,254
After you.

1021
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:50,123
And if there's anything
other that art

1022
01:15:50,156 --> 01:15:51,924
on the other side
of that door...

1023
01:15:52,925 --> 01:15:54,360
Yeah, I know.

1024
01:16:03,436 --> 01:16:04,904
Go in.

1025
01:16:59,926 --> 01:17:01,160
Wow.

1026
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:05,898
See that?

1027
01:17:09,936 --> 01:17:11,971
Don't!

1028
01:17:16,976 --> 01:17:20,413
Please...
take the paintings down.

1029
01:17:29,222 --> 01:17:31,123
Let me get the keys to your van.

1030
01:17:31,157 --> 01:17:34,393
- Oh, not my ride.
- Give me the keys to your van.

1031
01:17:43,002 --> 01:17:44,403
Take off your uniform.

1032
01:17:46,472 --> 01:17:48,241
I just met you.

1033
01:17:48,274 --> 01:17:50,776
Yeah, we're gonna get
a lot closer now.

1034
01:17:52,311 --> 01:17:55,348
Hey... Hey.

1035
01:17:55,381 --> 01:17:56,816
You got this?

1036
01:18:01,588 --> 01:18:03,256
Let's have a moment.

1037
01:18:06,092 --> 01:18:07,860
Contessa's back.

1038
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:16,402
Are you satisfied?

1039
01:18:16,435 --> 01:18:18,104
Alright, shut the fuck up.

1040
01:18:19,573 --> 01:18:21,340
I don't know.

1041
01:18:21,374 --> 01:18:23,209
I love the duck room.

1042
01:18:28,848 --> 01:18:30,449
Decoys, right?

1043
01:18:33,052 --> 01:18:34,453
Decoys...

1044
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:50,102
These are decoys?

1045
01:18:51,404 --> 01:18:55,875
Does that look like
a fucking masterpiece to you?

1046
01:18:55,908 --> 01:18:58,978
No...
You want the real shit?

1047
01:18:59,011 --> 01:19:02,248
Old man Nazi, fuck,
he hid them

1048
01:19:02,281 --> 01:19:04,317
in people's apartments.

1049
01:19:07,654 --> 01:19:12,024
Just hiding them...
right in plain sight.

1050
01:19:17,563 --> 01:19:19,098
Yeah...

1051
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,234
Let's go find them.

1052
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:26,405
Well, you got a way with words.

1053
01:19:26,439 --> 01:19:30,577
- I'll give you that, bro.
- Come.

1054
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:33,879
- We're cool.
- Don't worry, I'm gonna let you shoot him.

1055
01:19:33,913 --> 01:19:35,114
Okay.

1056
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,154
It's okay.

1057
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:45,625
It's okay.

1058
01:20:10,449 --> 01:20:12,251
Come on!

1059
01:20:18,157 --> 01:20:19,626
Hurry up!

1060
01:20:43,015 --> 01:20:45,985
If there's water coming in
there's a way out.

1061
01:20:47,486 --> 01:20:48,688
Come on, let's do this.

1062
01:20:50,322 --> 01:20:51,625
Shit.

1063
01:20:55,027 --> 01:20:57,530
The old man talked
his way into all the apartments?

1064
01:20:58,598 --> 01:21:00,499
Yeah, he owned the building.

1065
01:21:01,567 --> 01:21:03,269
Not anymore.

1066
01:21:33,032 --> 01:21:34,668
Oh, my God.

1067
01:21:35,702 --> 01:21:38,070
This is the crown jewel.

1068
01:21:38,772 --> 01:21:40,574
"The Concert."

1069
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,309
Johannes Vermeer.

1070
01:21:44,477 --> 01:21:47,747
Isabella Stewart Gardner
bought this painting

1071
01:21:47,781 --> 01:21:53,787
at an auction in Paris
in 1892 for $5,000.

1072
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:58,658
And now it has an
estimated worth; 200 million.

1073
01:22:01,327 --> 01:22:03,262
Art sucks.

1074
01:22:05,732 --> 01:22:07,634
Take it down.

1075
01:22:14,173 --> 01:22:16,208
Hey. Carefully.

1076
01:22:36,663 --> 01:22:39,633
Okay. Okay.
Hey, look at me.

1077
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:41,367
Look at me.
We're gonna be okay.

1078
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,769
We're not gonna die.

1079
01:22:42,802 --> 01:22:44,136
- Okay.
- Okay?

1080
01:22:45,204 --> 01:22:46,573
There's gotta be a way
out of here.

1081
01:22:46,606 --> 01:22:49,843
Hey, hey. This...
Hold this light.

1082
01:22:49,876 --> 01:22:51,578
- What are you doing?
- I'm going down.

1083
01:22:51,611 --> 01:22:53,613
Point the light down.
I'm going to find a way out.

1084
01:22:53,647 --> 01:22:56,248
Okay.
One, two three.

1085
01:23:06,693 --> 01:23:08,394
Oh, shit.

1086
01:23:25,411 --> 01:23:26,813
What's in there?

1087
01:23:27,581 --> 01:23:28,682
I don't know.

1088
01:23:28,715 --> 01:23:29,783
Nothing.

1089
01:23:31,685 --> 01:23:34,453
That's a lot of locks
for nothing.

1090
01:23:34,486 --> 01:23:36,155
Open the door.

1091
01:23:48,935 --> 01:23:52,338
Hey, hey, hey.

1092
01:23:52,906 --> 01:23:54,908
Anything?

1093
01:23:54,941 --> 01:23:57,409
I got you.

1094
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:00,580
Oh...

1095
01:24:00,614 --> 01:24:02,414
- Anything?
- I found it.

1096
01:24:02,448 --> 01:24:04,249
Take my... Take it.

1097
01:24:04,283 --> 01:24:06,653
- Okay.
- Okay. We're gonna get outta here.

1098
01:24:06,686 --> 01:24:09,623
Here we go.
One, two, three...

1099
01:24:25,304 --> 01:24:27,741
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Open it!

1100
01:24:29,709 --> 01:24:31,143
Alright.

1101
01:24:32,746 --> 01:24:34,313
Suit yourself.

1102
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:16,656
Knock, knock.

1103
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:18,792
How we holding up there, sir?

1104
01:25:19,626 --> 01:25:21,326
You doing alright?

1105
01:25:22,962 --> 01:25:24,931
I'm thankful to be alive.

1106
01:25:26,933 --> 01:25:28,702
Thank you, Doc.

1107
01:25:30,269 --> 01:25:32,706
Excuse me, sir.

1108
01:25:32,739 --> 01:25:34,974
Uh, I'm here to take a statement

1109
01:25:35,008 --> 01:25:38,912
on an incident that happened at an
apartment building not far from here.

1110
01:25:42,582 --> 01:25:44,383
Who woulda thought...

1111
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:46,786
that I'd be this happy to see
a cop walk through them doors.

1112
01:25:50,522 --> 01:25:52,391
How'd you get out?

1113
01:25:53,459 --> 01:25:55,494
Well, uh...

1114
01:25:56,730 --> 01:26:00,033
I fed your cat
while you were out.

1115
01:26:02,836 --> 01:26:04,938
<i>We have a 10-31 in progress.</i>

1116
01:26:04,971 --> 01:26:06,940
- That's our cue.
- On our way.

1117
01:26:06,973 --> 01:26:12,478
Yeah. Hey, Doc, um,
do you wanna look at my leg?

1118
01:26:12,511 --> 01:26:14,647
Mm, we already played doctor,
didn't we?

1119
01:26:14,681 --> 01:26:16,649
Are you going to take
my stitches out?

1120
01:26:16,683 --> 01:26:18,017
You gonna take me out?

1121
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:19,986
Bet your sweet ass I am.

1122
01:26:20,019 --> 01:26:23,690
I... I didn't mean it
like that, obviously

1123
01:26:23,723 --> 01:26:25,892
Respect to your,
like, workplace.

1124
01:26:25,925 --> 01:26:27,559
No pressure.

1125
01:26:27,594 --> 01:26:29,294
- No pressure.
- This is that moment...

1126
01:26:29,328 --> 01:26:30,562
- Yeah.
- ...where I'm gonna...

1127
01:26:30,597 --> 01:26:32,431
This can wait.

1128
01:26:32,464 --> 01:26:33,666
Yeah, of course.

1129
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,467
- I would not... not...
- No.

1130
01:26:35,501 --> 01:26:37,670
- I don't wanna cross any lines.
- No. I know.

1131
01:26:37,704 --> 01:26:41,340
Okay. Can I...
If I beg you?

1132
01:26:45,044 --> 01:26:47,814
Alright. Let's go.

1133
01:26:47,847 --> 01:26:48,982
Rock me like a hurricane.

1134
01:26:49,015 --> 01:26:50,516
Hey...

1135
01:26:50,549 --> 01:26:52,919
- I got you something.
- Okay.

1136
01:27:09,002 --> 01:27:10,569
Fuck.

1137
01:27:12,404 --> 01:27:14,741
Now I gotta figure out
how to sell this shit.
